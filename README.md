## What is Proactive ?

Proactive is a versatile tool designed to help you accomplish challenging tasks efficiently or serve as a convenient day-to-day productivity companion.

#How Does It Work?
Before explaining how Proactive helps, let’s address why certain goals often feel out of reach:
1) Achieving new goals requires time, patience, and consistency.
2) While starting a new journey, enthusiasm is high. However, over time, motivation fades, leading to abandoned plans.
3) The primary reason? When the effort required outweighs the joy of achievement, initial goals are forgotten.
Proactive aims to resolve these challenges through a structured approach to productivity.
