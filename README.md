before telling how ,lets see why some goals looks difficult to learn.
To learn any new thing it requires time , patience and consistecy.
Most of us when starts a new goal to learn new thing, were energetic but after few days or week we loose this energy and drop the plan to learn that part and switch to something else.

When the burden of doing it outweighs the joy, we starts to divert our mind and forgets our original goal.
Some of these problem can be fixed by proactive.
